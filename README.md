This data analysis is ment to provide insights of regional sales for the Company House Depot for the year of 2023. Through the collection and analysis of the sales data, we look to map out, what cities in Califonia have the most sales, deliveries, and Installations of Household appliances. Through the mapped out data we look to identify trends to make data driven recommendations, and to help the comapany understand where their products are selling the best.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: House Depot provided me with a box full of files which contained the information detailing each sale in 2023. I then built a spreadsheet containing all of needed information to preform the regional analysis.
